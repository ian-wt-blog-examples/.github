# Welcome!
This 'organization' contains repos that provide examples, demos, and support for the blog articles I write at [ianwaldron.com](https://ianwaldron.com).

My blog covers a range of topics such as business and real estate. But most of what's contained here will be surrounding the topic [technology](https://ianwaldron.com/blog/topic/technology/).

I enjoy building projects with [Django](https://ianwaldron.com/blog/tag/django/), [python](https://ianwaldron.com/blog/tag/python/), [javascript](https://ianwaldron.com/blog/tag/javascript/), and related frameworks and libraries.

In addition to this organization, checkout my public Github profile @ian-wt where I host templates, data, and so on.

If you're interested in connecting, the best way is to follow me on [X](https://x.com/ianwaldron_wt).
